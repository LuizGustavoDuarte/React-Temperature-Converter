# React Temperature Converter

This is my first React project, it was made from the requisites of DevProjects and you can check those at:
[Reqs from DevProjects](https://www.codementor.io/projects/temperature-converter-website-atx32dy7mf)



## Made using:

### Yarn
You need to yarn add or npm install, then in the project directory, you can run:

`yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser

### Reactstrap

I was used to Bootstrap CSS when programming in PHP so decided to use it to help in this attempt


## Project While Running

Should look like this:
